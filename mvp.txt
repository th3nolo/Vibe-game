# MVP Implementation Plan

This file outlines the steps to implement the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the MMO RPG server. The goal is to validate core concepts: procedural generation, multiplayer interactions, and initial cursor/control mechanics.

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Lobby Instance Management**  
   - Create and manage multiple lobby instances with a defined user limit (e.g., 50 users).  
   - Automatically create new instances when one reaches capacity.

2. **Procedural Generation**  
   - Use WebAssembly (WASM) to generate lobby environments efficiently.  
   - Validate that generated layouts are usable and performant.

3. **Multiplayer Interactions**  
   - Handle user connections and real-time updates (e.g., movement) using worker threads and `SharedArrayBuffer`.  
   - Ensure updates are synchronized across connected users.

4. **Cursor/Control Mechanics**  
   - Implement basic movement or interaction mechanics (e.g., updating user positions) to simulate control input.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Project Structure  
- Create the folder structure as defined in `.cursorrules`.  
- Initialize `package.json` with dependencies: `express`, `ws`, `jest`, and others as needed.

### 2. Implement Lobby Management  
- Create `src/core/lobby/lobbyManager.js` with a `LobbyManager` class.  
  - Add methods: `joinLobby(userId)` and `createLobby()`.  
  - Track lobby instances and user counts.

### 3. Develop Procedural Generation  
- Write C++ code in `src/wasm/procedural_generator.cpp` for lobby layout generation.  
- Compile to WASM using Emscripten with a script in `scripts/build_wasm.sh`.  
- Create `src/wasm/proceduralGenerator.js` to load and call the WASM module.

### 4. Set Up Worker Threads for Lobbies  
- Implement `src/core/lobby/lobbyWorker.js` to manage lobby logic in a worker thread.  
- Use `SharedArrayBuffer` to share lobby state (e.g., user positions) between threads.

### 5. Configure Main Server  
- Set up `src/server/server.js` with WebSocket support using the `ws` library.  
- Route client messages to appropriate worker threads.

### 6. Test the MVP  
- Create a simple test client (e.g., a Node.js script or HTML page) to simulate multiple users.  
- Verify:  
  - New lobbies are created when capacity is reached.  
  - Procedural generation works and is fast.  
  - Users can join and see real-time position updates.

## Validation Criteria  
- **Procedural Generation**: WASM generates lobby layouts in under 1 second.  
- **Multiplayer**: Users in the same lobby see position updates within 100ms.  
- **Controls**: Basic movement mechanics function without errors.  
- **Stability**: Server handles 100 simulated users without crashing.
